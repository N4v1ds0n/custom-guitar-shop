## Design
The website’s design communicates a clear message wrappe in a warm and retro-styled look. The feel of the site should, inspire creativity, and support user engagement. The combination of elegant typography like Playfair Display and Yesteryear fonts with high-quality imagery gives a sense of artisanal quality and custom design. A detailed form shows that individuality and user input are valued.
Structured layout, consistent styling, and responsive design signal that this is a serious workshop, not a hobbyist page.

### Colour
As core- colors dark green and red colours in combination with cream/beige tones evoke a vintage, handcrafted vibe — cozy and welcoming, like aged wood or classic amps.<br> 
The high contrast gives the site a profesional and accessible look.
