## Design

### Design Choices
The website’s design communicates a clear message wrapped in a warm and retro-styled look. The vintage look with high-quality imagery should, inspire creativity, and support user engagement. A detailed form shows that individuality and user input are valued.
Structured layout, consistent styling, and responsive design signal that this is a serious workshop, not a hobbyist page.

### Colour
As core- colors dark green and red colours in combination with cream/beige tones evoke a vintage, handcrafted vibe — cozy and welcoming, like aged wood or classic amps.<br> 
The high contrast gives the site a profesional and accessible look.

### Fonts
The combination of elegant typography like Playfair Display and Yesteryear fonts gives a sense of artisanal quality and custom design.

### Structure
The website follows a clear, user-friendly structure:
- Index (Home): A welcoming introduction to the luthier and his offerings.
- About: In-depth details about the shop's philosophy and craftsmanship.
- Gallery: Detailed images of various guitars, organized by type, with modals for closer inspection.
